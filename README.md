# Aerofit Treadmill Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the customer data for Aerofit, a leading brand in fitness equipment. The goal is to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by Aerofit, thereby enabling the company to make better product recommendations to new customers. The analysis focuses on customer profiling, probability analysis, and generating actionable business insights.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes information about individuals who purchased a treadmill from Aerofit stores over the past three months. It contains the following features:

- **Product**: The treadmill model purchased (KP281, KP481, or KP781).
- **Age**: Customer's age in years.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Education**: Years of education completed.
- **MaritalStatus**: Single or Partnered.
- **Usage**: Average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week.
- **Income**: Annual income (in USD).
- **Fitness**: Self-rated fitness on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).
- **Miles**: Average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week.

### Product Portfolio

- **KP281**: Entry-level treadmill priced at $1,500.
- **KP481**: Mid-level treadmill priced at $1,750.
- **KP781**: Advanced treadmill with additional features, priced at $2,500.

## Project Objectives

1. **Customer Profiling**: Develop profiles for customers purchasing different treadmill models.
2. **Probability Analysis**: Calculate marginal and conditional probabilities to understand customer preferences.
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and analyze outliers in the dataset.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Explore relationships between different customer characteristics and their impact on product choice.
5. **Business Insights**: Generate actionable insights to help Aerofit improve its product recommendations and marketing strategies.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis will be performed using the following steps:

1. **Initial Data Exploration**:
   - Import and explore the dataset, checking for data types, structure, and missing values.
   - Conduct a statistical summary of the dataset.

2. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Detect outliers using boxplots and the "describe" method by examining the difference between mean and median.

3. **Customer Profiling**:
   - Create customer profiles using descriptive statistics and visualizations (countplot, histograms, boxplots).
   - Analyze the effect of features like marital status, age, income, and fitness on product choice.

4. **Probability Analysis**:
   - Construct two-way contingency tables and compute marginal and conditional probabilities.
   - Example: What is the probability of a male customer buying the KP781 treadmill?

5. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Use heatmaps and pair plots to check correlations among different factors.

6. **Business Insights**:
   - Based on the analysis, generate insights about customer preferences and behavior.

7. **Recommendations**:
   - Provide actionable recommendations for Aerofit, focusing on customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
